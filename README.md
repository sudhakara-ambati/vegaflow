# VegaFlow

**VegaFlow** is a Rust-based toolkit for pricing European options using both analytical and simulation-based models. It implements the Black-Scholes formula and a Monte Carlo simulation engine based on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

It also integrates real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance and the FRED API, allowing for dynamic pricing based on current market conditions.

## Features

- Black-Scholes model for calculating theoretical option prices.
- Monte Carlo simulation using GBM for estimating prices based on asset path behavior.
- Real-time stock data retrieval via the Yahoo Finance API.
- Live risk-free rate data from the FRED API.
- Regression to predict IV using historical data

## Example Usage (coming soon)

## Goals
- Provide multiple methods for calculating and comparing option prices.
- Explore how market volatility and randomness affect pricing accuracy.
- Offer a flexible base for extending to other types of options or pricing models.

## In Progress
- Web application with visualisations of regression for IV
